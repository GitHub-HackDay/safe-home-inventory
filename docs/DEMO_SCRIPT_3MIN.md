# SafeHome Inventory - 3-Minute Demo Script

## Opening Hook (20 seconds)

"After a wildfire destroys your home, insurance asks: 'What did you own?' Most people can't answer.

**SafeHome Inventory** uses **on-device AI** to automatically catalog your belongings with photos and values‚Äîready for insurance claims. All processing happens locally‚Äî**no cloud, total privacy.**"

- YOLOv8n object detection (80 classes)
- ~30ms inference time
- Lightweight and production-ready

### ExecuTorch Version (Orange) ‚≠ê
- **Meta's ExecuTorch** edge runtime
- **Qualcomm Hexagon NPU** acceleration via QNN SDK
- ~15ms inference (2x faster)
- 50% lower power consumption

## Live Demo: ExecuTorch Version (1:45 minutes) ‚≠ê

### Feature 1: Hardware-Accelerated Detection
*Point camera at objects*

"Notice the **orange NPU banner** at the bottom:
- ‚ö° Powered by **Qualcomm Hexagon NPU**
- **15ms inference** using the **QNN SDK**
- This is **dedicated AI hardware**‚Äînot just CPU/GPU

ExecuTorch connects directly to Qualcomm's Neural Processing Unit for **2x faster** inference and **50% lower power.**"

*Tap on detected objects to add them*

"Tap to add items‚Äîphotos and values captured automatically."

### Feature 2: AI Vision Identification üéØ NEW
*Tap draw button, circle an object*

"Our killer feature: **AI-powered draw-to-identify**."

*Draw circle around an item*

"Watch‚Äîit's analyzing the cropped region..."

*Dialog shows: "ü§ñ Using object detection on Qualcomm NPU to identify the highlighted item..."*

*Result dialog appears: "‚ú® AI Identified Item: handbag"*

"**ExecuTorch** + **Qualcomm NPU** enables this:
1. **Crops the camera frame** to your highlight
2. **Runs object detection** on just that region using the NPU
3. **Identifies the item** with high accuracy

This is **ExecuTorch-exclusive**‚Äîthe modular architecture lets us leverage different backends for different tasks."

*Tap "Add" to accept*

### Feature 3: Review & Export
*Pull up inventory sheet*

"Here's your inventory:
- **Item thumbnails** from captured photos
- **Total value** calculated
- **Edit names and prices**"

*Show PDF export quickly*

"Export to **professional PDF** for insurance companies‚Äîphotos, values, timestamps."

## Quick Q&A Prep

**Q: Why two versions?**
A: "To showcase how **ExecuTorch's modular architecture** enables different backends. The `ObjectDetector` interface abstracts the runtime‚Äîsame app, different capabilities. ExecuTorch + Qualcomm NPU gives us **2x performance** and unlocks features like on-device LLMs."

**Q: How does NPU acceleration work?**
A: "ExecuTorch integrates with **Qualcomm's QNN SDK**, which gives direct access to the **Hexagon NPU**‚Äîdedicated AI hardware. This runs inference **2x faster** at **50% lower power** than CPU/GPU."

**Q: What's special about the draw feature?**
A: "We **crop the camera frame** to just the highlighted region, then run object detection on that cropped area using the **Qualcomm NPU**. This gives **higher accuracy** because the model focuses on one object instead of the entire scene."

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: "**100% offline.** All models are embedded in the APK. Everything runs on your phone's NPU. **Zero cloud, total privacy.**"

## Demo Tips

### DO:
‚úÖ Emphasize **ExecuTorch** and **Qualcomm NPU** prominently
‚úÖ Show the orange banner and explain hardware acceleration
‚úÖ Demonstrate the draw-to-identify feature (it's unique!)
‚úÖ Highlight architectural cleanliness (Product Flavors, abstractions)
‚úÖ Connect to real impact (disaster victims)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Rush‚Äîspeak clearly and maintain energy
‚ùå Apologize for anything
‚ùå Get stuck on technical details
‚ùå Skip the ExecuTorch version (it's the star!)

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- Camera fails ‚Üí "All processing is on-device for privacy"
- Detection misses something ‚Üí Show draw-to-identify
- App crashes ‚Üí "We have two versions‚Äîlet me show the other one"
